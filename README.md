# Project Details
Weather app that displays the important at a glance weather data in a central block and allows more weather detail as you scroll down the page.

This is my first time working with APIs in React.js
The APIs I used were the OpenWeather API at https://openweathermap.org/ and the GeoLocation app at the same link.
